General Linux Instructions:
 1. Install PostgreSQL using your system's package manager
(2) For some systems you would need to activate the postgres service. Consult the beforementioned guide 
 3. Switch to the default postgres user (create one if needed):
    sudo -u postgres -i
(4) Sometimes you would also need to initialise a database cluster. Consult the guide
    for more information.
 5. Create a new postgres role (use the same name as your Linux username,
    otherwise you would have to specify your username each time you use psql with -U userName)
    createuser --interactive
 6. Create a new database:
    createdb databaseName
 7. Switch back to your user by pressing CTRL+d

#How to use PostgreSQL from the command line:
Method 1: Using the database shell:
1. Access the shell using:
   psql -d databaseName
2. Write a query or a meta command inside the shell. A query should always end with a semicolon.

Some helpful commands:
Show information about all tables in the current database:
=> \dt
List databases
=> \l
Exit/quit the psql shell:
=> \q or CTRL+d
To see all meta-commands run:
=> \?
Get help:
=> \help

Method 2: Using a SQL script
1. Create a document test.sql using your favourite editor
   (you can get SQL syntax highlighting and other goodies for your editor to make your life easier)
2. Write your SQL commands inside the document.
3. Run it as you would run a python script using:
   psql -d databaseName -f test.sql

#SQL script you can try 
DROP TABLE items;
CREATE TABLE items (
id     integer PRIMARY KEY,
name   varchar(40)
);
INSERT INTO items VALUES (1, 'Item1');
SELECT * FROM items;
